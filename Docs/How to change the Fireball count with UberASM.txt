To the change the fireball count on a per-level basis, apply MoreFireballs.asm to the level that you want in list_uberasm.txt in the UberASM folder.

If you are using other UberASM on your level you can use the following method by adding the following to your desired uberASM file:

    ; Make sure this is the same as the patch
    !fireballs_freeram = $60

    ; How many fireballs to have in this level
    !fireballs_level_amount = $05

    init:
        lda.b #!fireballs_level_amount
        sta !fireballs_freeram
        rtl
