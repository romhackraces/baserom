@backup_hack.bat
----------------

This script is available to let you make time-stamped backups of various parts of your hack. In the Command Prompt you will see a menu with a list of the following backup options for your hack:

> "Any modified levels"

This will use Lunar Magic's level export feature to save all modified levels as .mwl files to a folder in "Backup/Levels" theat is time-stamped as a sort of versioning action.

> "All of Map16"

This will use Lunar Magic's map16 export feature to save *all* of your hack's map16 (not sections of it) to a file in the "Backup/Map16" folder that is time stamped in case you want to recover some older map16 changes.

> "Shared Palette"

This will use Lunar Magic's map16 export feature to save a copy of the *shared* palette (not the palettes of individual levels) in the "Backup/Palettes" folder, this action is also time-stamped. This is only really necessary if you modify the shared palettes of the ROM as individual level palettes will be saved when you export levels in the first option.

> "ROM file"

This just makes a time-stamped copy of your hack's ROM file in the "Backups/ROM" folder, so you can access older versions.
