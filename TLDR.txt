Here's the tl;dr for getting the baserom up and running for your project:

    1. Run "@initialize_baserom.bat" to set up the baserom with all the needed tools to be a happy hacker

    2. Place a copy of your (headered) copy of Super Mario World in the main baserom folder, renamed "clean.smc"

    3. In the LunarHelper folder, edit "config_baserom.txt" (and optionally the other config files) to your preference.

    4. Run LunarHelper.exe to rebuild the baserom after all your changes have been made and your preferences have been set.

Happy hacking!
