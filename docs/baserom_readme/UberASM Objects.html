<h2>UberASM objects</h2>
<p>The baserom uses a framework of custom objects to allow you to toggle or activate some simple UberASM codes that are in the baserom, most of which are very basic utility features. They are activated simply by inserting a custom extension object into whichever levels you want with no real limit. These objects work in conjunction with any level UberASM you may want to use as well.</p>

<h3 id="available-objects">Available Objects</h3>
<p>The following objects can be used to enable or toggle features or settings in the baserom.</p>
<table border="1" class="full">
<tr><th>#</th><th>Object</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>98</td><td>Free Vertical Scroll</td><td>Makes the camera follow Mario up and down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>99</td><td>Lock Horizontal Scroll</td><td>Prevents the camera from scrolling left or right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9A</td><td>Start in OFF State</td><td>Starts the level with the ON/OFF state in the OFF state on level load.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9B</td><td>Toggle Block Duplication</td><td>Block duplication is patched in the baserom. This object will set a flag to disable the patch that prevents block duplication.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9C</td><td>Toggle Statusbar</td><td>Completely hide the in game statusbar, note: this does not disable the item box.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9D</td><td>Toggle Screen Scroll</td><td>Scrolling the screen with L or R is disabled by default in the baserom but this will enable it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9E</td><td>Enable SFX Echo</td><td>Enabled the echo for sound effects, provided your level has custom music with echo enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A0</td><td>No Power Ups</td><td>Use this object to prevent power-up collection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A2</td><td>Enable Vanilla Cape Turnaround</td><td>The baserom has patched turning around in the air with spin during cape to make it guaranteed on button press. Using this object will disable that consistency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A3</td><td>Enable 8-frame Cape Float</td><td>Cape floating is vanilla in the baserom but using this object will apply a consistent 8 frame counter after the input is registered to adjust Mario's falling speed with cape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A4</td><td>Zero Cape Float Delay</td><td>Using this object will remove the delay before Mario starts floating with cape.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A5</td><td>Death on Power-up Loss</td><td>Makes it so losing a power up will kill Mario instantly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A7</td><td>Press L &amp; R To Die</td><td>Kills the player if L and R are pressed. Useful for a quick reset.</td></tr>

<h3 id="inserting-objects">Inserting Custom Objects</h3>
<p>To insert a custom object either use the "Edit > Insert manual..." menu action or press the <code>Insert</code> key while in Lunar Magic's Object editing mode to bring up the following window.</p>
<center><img src="img/insert_object_manual.png"></center>
<p>To insert a custom UberASM object put its value from the tables below in the <b>Size/Type/Ext</b> field seen above. Multiple custom UberASM objects can be active in one level when they are inserted one at time.</p>
<p>When inserted, custom objects will look garbled in Lunar Magic since they load a "null" object but they won't actually appear in game. The tiles they are made up of may occasionally use an exit-enabled (door) tile which may display a warning depending on your Lunar Magic settings.</p>
