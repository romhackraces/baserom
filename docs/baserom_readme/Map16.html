<h3>Point of Advice</h3>
<p>You should use Lunar Magic's "Add Objects" window as much as possible to construct your levels instead of placing tiles directly from map16. Objects that are composed of several tiles take up fewer bytes in-ROM when placed in levels. When you use direct map16, each tile placed in a level counts as its own object in the level and this can dramatically increase the bytesize of levels if there are many many tiles.</p>
<h3>Map16 Pages</h3>
<p>If you're viewing this Readme on the web, any of the below may appear different depending on which version of the baserom you are using.</p>
