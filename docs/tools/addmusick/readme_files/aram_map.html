	<h1>ARAM Map</h1><br><br>
The following contains ARAM usage past and present, including the latest version of AddmusicK. These mostly only cover the stable ARAM locations from $0000-$04FF, with some exceptions. Please note that they are sorted by when memory locations were discontinued (or changed), with the latest version containing all of the current memory locations sorted by source (New meaning that it debuted in the latest version).<br>

Romi's Addmusic (Addmusic404)'s custom code used no new memory locations, and therefore is de facto not included in this list.<br>

	<h2>Latest Version</h2>
		NOTE: $0400-$04FF are omitted from here and AddmusicK because the SPC700 program starts at $0400 rather than $0500.
