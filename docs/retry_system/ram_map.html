  <h2>Retry RAM Map</h2>
  <p>This documents serves as a detailed reference on the purpose of the RAM addresses used by Retry, and how you can use them.</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Retry uses a chunk of RAM at <code>$7FB400</code> (<code>$40A400</code> on SA-1 roms) by default. The size of this area is <code>230 + (4*!max_custom_midway_num)</code> bytes (where <code>!max_custom_midway_num</code> is defined in <code>settings.asm</code>).</p>
  <p>The default address should be fine in most cases, but if you want to change it because of some freeram conflict, open <code>ram.asm</code> and edit <code>!retry_freeram</code> (<code>!retry_freeram_sa1</code> if you're using SA-1).</p>
  <p>In the <code>ram.asm</code> file you can also see the name for the different addresses, defined as <code>%retry_ram(name,$XX)</code>, where <code>$XX</code> specifies the offset from the base <code>!retry_freeram</code> address. The full address name is resolved to <code>!ram_name</code> and <code>!ram_retry_name</code>.

  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>If you need to perform read/write operations on the Retry RAM addresses, you can do as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For UberASM codes, the addresses can be referenced simply using the label <code>retry_ram_name</code> for a specific address <code>name</code>. For example, if you want to check if the player is respawning, you can do: <code>LDA retry_ram_is_respawning : BNE respawning</code>.</li>
    <li>For all other codes, you'll need to copy the contents of the <code>ram.asm</code> file inside your patch/sprite/block file, then you can reference them either with the <code>!retry_ram_name</code> defines or the <code>retry_ram_name</code> label. If you need them for sprites, it's suggested to copy the contents inside PIXI's <code>sa1def.asm</code> file, and in case of blocks to copy them inside GPS's <code>defines.asm</code>. This way the addresses will be available in all sprites/blocks without having to copy them multiple times.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RAM information</h3>
  <p>Here is the table containing information about all addresses used by Retry, including their name and size.</p>
  <p>Addresses that are labeled as <code>Internal</code> are used internally by Retry and shouldn't be written to outside of it (although you can read them to know the state of some of Retry's operations, such as the respawning example earlier). Addresses that are labeled as <code>User</code> are meant to be written by the user to enable or customize some of Retry's features.</p>
  <p>Note that the first 13 bytes (<code>$00-$0B</code>) are laid out exactly as the original Retry patch (and have the same function), to keep compatibility with resources that used them or that expect them to be arranged in a certain way. For this reason it's recommended not to change them.</p>

It's mainly used by the vanilla/custom midway objects, but you can also write to it yourself if you're making your own midways or you need to change the checkpoint dynamically. It can be used in 3 ways:
        <ul>
          <li>If the low byte is set to any value other than <code>$FF</code> and <code>$80</code> (for example, <code>$00</code>), but you don't change the high byte, then a checkpoint will be triggered depending on this level's <code>checkpoint_effect</code> table settings. This would be the preferred way to use it if making a custom midway block/sprite.</li>
          <li>If the whole 16-bit value is set to an entrance value, following the format of <code>$7E19B8</code> and <code>$7E19D8</code>, then a checkpoint will be set using this entrance as the respawn destination. This can be used to have custom checkpoints that use any main/midway/secondary entrance as destination, similarly to Retry's custom midway objects.</li>
          <li>If the low byte is set to <code>$80</code>, then the current level's checkpoint will be reset to the main level's entrance, effectively erasing the current checkpoint. In this case the high byte is ignored.</li>
